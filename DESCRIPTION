Description: Monte Carlo simulations of a game-theoretic model for the 
	legal exemption system of the European cartel law are implemented
	in order to estimate the (mean) deterrent effect of this system.
	The input and output parameters of the simulated cartel 
	opportunities can be visualized by three-dimensional projections.
